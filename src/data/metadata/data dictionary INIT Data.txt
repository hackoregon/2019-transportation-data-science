Data Dictionary
TriMet raw data.
Miles J. Crumley, MS - Operations Analyst: Bus Transportation/Maintenance

You have been provided with many tables:
	init_tripsh - Init Trip Data Historical
	init_veh_stop - Init Stop data Historical
	init_cyclic - INIT vehicle moving data
	trimet_stop_event - TriMet Stop Event Data

Date Range: Sep, Oct, Nov 2017
All Bus data
Stop Event Rail data.
Route Numbers that are 921,922 are deadhead routes. You can exclude them from analysis but their points are still valuable for evaulating deadheads.
Block Numbers that end in 99 and descending is fill service. You can exclude that from regular analysis but it is still important to us because it allows us 
	to better understand service restoration
Anything else that looks "weird" can likely be excluded.

	Blocks that end in 99 are generally extra service blocks or unscheduled blocks for broken service.

		'bay' - typically 15 meters before and 10 meters after a stop.
	2 – Unplanned door open 
		Door open in the 'encatchment' which is 4% of distance to next stop. 
		Max Length is 60 meters after stop
		This includes the stop 'bay'
	3 – Disturbance stop
